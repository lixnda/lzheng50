NOTES:
*pyplot is a submodule of matplotlib and is used to generate interactive plots? is efficient and simple to use
*ran into error: " Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'NSWindow should only be instantiated on the main thread!'"
    - seems to be an error specific to mac users
    -SOLVED: "matplotlib.use('Agg')"
        *AGG is the renderer for png filetypes but im not sure what it has to do with "main threads" (what is main threads??)
*ro used to make plotted points red(r) and circle(o)
*seems like numpy wasn't necessary (why do the matplotlib docs use them then)
*need to denotate a new figure by declaring: "plt.figure()" in order to ensure no mixes happen btw two graphs
