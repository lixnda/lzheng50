this is plaintext. no formatting. just [3 chords and] the truth

Q: What happens when you access this file
     via
      http://localhost:5000/static/foo 
     ?
The link tells me that I do not have access to localhost.
     

NOTA BENE:
 Keep yourself honest by
   jotting down or verbalizing
     to your neighbourhood Devos+Duckies your prediction
       --- BEFORE you run your test.
I think the link would work adjacently to how http://127.0.0.1:5000 would. Since both are operated locally I think. These two urls also have :5000 at the end.
