QCC:
*When does the session key change?
*When users need to submit passwords as a part of their login, where is there stored when sessions typically end?

DISCO:
* When loading an url, you are using a get request, so you need to make sure that the app.route is able to hand the get method.
* Forms use the post request as a way to make the information submitted more secure
