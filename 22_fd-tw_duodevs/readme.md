DISCO
    *Compared to Bootstrap, foundations seems to have more flexibity in custimizing each element (less pre-coded elements), but it also means more classes and tags.
        *In bootstrap, for example there were built in navbars, but in foundations the tags used was "top-bar" instead, which implies a wider ability to adjust it.
    *Bootstrap seems to be more focused on utility while Tailwind focuses more on customization,.==
    *Tailwind seems to have its own way of declaring colors (instead of using hexcode or rgb, you put color family and then a number showing how dark things are). It also has it's own way to show sides. Py and Px are margins (Px is left margin, py is height/width of box)

QCC
    *Are div tags necessary for foundations?

*q1:
I prefer bootstrap more because the functions just seem more streamlined, and it doesn't take away from the ability for developers to customize their page. Also, the tag lines are easier for me to understand and implement compared to tailwind and foundations. However, I like tailwind as well because of their color schemes, which helps sites look nicer.
