DISCOVERIES:
----------------------------------------------------
* csv.DictReader() reads a CSV file into an ordered dictionary, where the keys are the column headers (first row), and the values are the data from each subsequent row.
* csv.reader() allows you to read data from a CSV file line by line. Each line is returned as a list of strings, where each string represents a cell in that row.
* csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames): Writes dictionaries to a CSV file.
* select * from TABLE shows the table you created in the terminal
* To insert variables into a SQL query, use parameterized query using ? placeholders.
