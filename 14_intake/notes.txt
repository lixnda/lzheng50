QCC:
 *what is the significance of DIAG?
 *what function is app.py using when requesting headers? does the "***" play a role? What does it even do. 
	->uncomment code to test

 *when running testmodO.py, where does the return statement go if we aren't running a webapp? The print statements do, however, get printed in the terminal

DISCO:
 *form seems to be a built in feature of html, and having action="/auth" allows a input text box. However, in what way can it be used to log a certain user in?

*by requesting headers, the terminal returns several lines of information regarding the current machine and browser.

*when uncommenting the comment that requests a username, the webapp returns a KeyError: 'username'
	->but since users have to enter the username in the page, how is it possible for variable to have value before user input?
	->having this request in the autherization page does work, however. I'm assuming because we now have information on the username that the user previously submitted
